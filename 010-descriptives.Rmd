## Overview {-}

In Italy there are 23 medical surgical (M/S) Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs):

- 11 in the north
- 8 in the center
- 4 in the south

of the country.

Data reported here analyze patients admitted in PICUs from
`r params$first_y` to `r params$last_y`.

Only children 0 -- 16 years old who have a severity score on admission
which allow to estimate a Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) were
considered.

Exclusion criteria were "preterm or > 16 years old", or not completed
